# Operating System Architecture

## Activity Description
Develop a file system that simulates EXT3 standard. The system must be developed in C or C++ using the POSIX system calls.

Its task is to implement in the fs.cpp file the functions declared in the fs.h file to manipulate a file on disk whose contents simulate an EXT3 file system. This file must be in the format specified in this document. Your implementation will be tested with a set of unit tests available in the main.cpp file using the OpenSSL library and Google Test.
